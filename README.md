Follow the instructions below to complete the list of tasks:

1. Visit [gil-interns repo](https://github.com/beyond2013/gil-interns) to download the dataset you are required to use. It is provided in zip compressed format. The name of the file is titanic.zip.

2. You have to create a machine learning model to predict which passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

3. You will use the train.csv file for training your model. Once your model is ready, use it to predict the survival of passengers in test.csv.

4. Do not forget to employ appropriate steps to account for missing values if any in the datasets.

5. You may create plots for exploring the training datasets e.g. the proportion of male and female passengers, or to investigate if a specific gender survived more than the other.

6. Write a brief description of which machine learning model you chose and why? Did your model perform up to your expectation on unseen data?

7. When you are done, upload your code to a github repo and email the link to imran[dot]cs[dot]uob[at]gmail[dot]com.
